                         THE FOX AND THE CROW



A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window, and
flew up with it into a high tree, that she might eat it at her ease. A
Fox having spied her came and sat underneath and began to pay the Crow
compliments on her beauty. "Why," said he, "I never saw it before, but
your feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in
my life! Ah! what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! And I have
no doubt but you have a tolerable voice. If it is but as fine as your
complexion, I do not know a bird that can match you."

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled
about, and hardly knew where she was. But thinking the Fox a little
doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him
right in the matter, she began to sing, and in the same instant, down
dropped the cheese; which the Fox presently chopped up, and then bade
her remember that whatever he had said of her beauty, he had spoken
nothing yet of her brains.
