                        THE LION AND THE MOUSE



A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he
was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him. The
Lion clapped his paw on the frightened little creature, and was about
to make an end of him in a moment, when the Mouse, in pitiable tone,
begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware. The
Lion looking kindly on his little prisoner's fright, generously let him
go. Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, while ranging
the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters; and finding
himself entangled without hope of escape, set up a roar that filled the
whole forest with its echo. The Mouse, quickly recognising the Lion's
voice, ran to the spot, and without more ado set to work to nibble the
knot in the cord that bound him, and in a short time, set him free;
thus showing him that kindness is seldom thrown away, and that there is
no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power
to return a good deed.
