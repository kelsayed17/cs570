                         THE FOX AND THE STORK


A fox one day invited a Stork to dinner, and being disposed to divert
himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner
but some thin soup in a shallow dish. This the Fox lapped up very
readily, while the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long
narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The
Fox, meanwhile, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly,
and hoped that the dish was seasoned to her mind. The Stork, seeing
that she was played upon, took no notice of it, but pretended to
enjoy herself extremely; and at parting begged the Fox to return the
visit. So he agreed to dine with her the next day. He arrived in good
time, and dinner was ordered forthwith; but when it was served up, he
found to his dismay, that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall,
narrow-necked jar. Down this the Stork easily thrust her long neck and
bill, while the Fox had to content himself with licking the outside of
the jar. "I am very glad," said the Stork, "that you seem to have so
good an appetite; and I hope you will make as hearty a dinner at my
table as I did the other day at yours." At this the Fox hung down his
head and showed his teeth--"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "don't pretend
to be out of humour about the matter; they that cannot take a jest
should never make one."
