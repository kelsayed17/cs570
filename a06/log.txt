                     THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER


On a cold frosty day in winter, the Ants were dragging out some of
the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it. The
Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger, begged the ants to give him a
morsel of it to save his life. "Nay," said they, "but you should have
worked in the summer, and you would not have wanted in winter."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, "but I was not idle either, for I sung
out the whole season!" "Nay, then," said the Ants," you'll do well to
make a merry year of it, and dance in winter to the tune that you sung
in summer. "
